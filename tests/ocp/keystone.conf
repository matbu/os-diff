# From keystone

# Using this feature is *NOT* recommended. Instead, use the `keystone-manage
# bootstrap` command. The value of this option is treated as a "shared secret"
# that can be used to bootstrap Keystone through the API. This "token" does not
# represent a user (it has no identity), and carries no explicit authorization
# (it effectively bypasses most authorization checks). If set to `None`, the
# value is ignored and the `admin_token` middleware is effectively disabled.
# (string value)

# The base public endpoint URL for Keystone that is advertised to clients
# (NOTE: this does NOT affect how Keystone listens for connections). Defaults
# to the base host URL of the request. For example, if keystone receives a
# request to `http://server:5000/v3/users`, then this will option will be
# automatically treated as `http://server:5000`. You should only need to set
# option if either the value of the base URL contains a path that keystone does
# not automatically infer (`/prefix/v3`), or if the endpoint should be found on
# a different host. (uri value)
